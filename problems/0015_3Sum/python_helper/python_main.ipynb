    "Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that` i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.\n",

    "The above leet-code problem is poorly phrased. It's wording \"Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triples\" suggests that based on the condition they had given, the solution set will not contain duplicate triplets. However, this is not the case. Strictly following these conditions means that example 1 should produce an output of [[-1,0,-1],[-1,0,-1],[-1,-1,2]]. Instead, this sentence should have stated \"the solution set should also only contain unique triplets\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below does not pass all of the leetcode cases. I have moved on from this question since I do not want to delve into whether my code is correct or if there are other nuances in their wording that I did not capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should however follow up with the leetcode solutions and these types of problems since there seems to be many variations."
